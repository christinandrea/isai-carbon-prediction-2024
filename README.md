## Testingüìä

The model was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the R¬≤ score metrics. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed model achieved a MAPE of 0.10 (10% error) and an R¬≤ score of 0.75. These results suggest that the model performs well.

This model is proven to succeed in real data prediction through a [comparison test](https://github.com/christinandrea/isai-carbon-prediction-2024/tree/main/test) between real and predicted carbon values. The model shows the least error at 25m height, with a result of 6.77%.


## Deploymentüåê

The objective is to implement the proposed model in a real-world application, utilising a serverless architecture with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The core AWS components employed for this purpose are AWS Lambda for the inference process and Amazon API Gateway for the endpoint.
